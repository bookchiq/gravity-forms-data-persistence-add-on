This plugin makes your Gravity Forms data-persistent.

== Description ==

Consider this scenario:

a) Your site uses multipage <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a>.
b) Your user logs in to the site and starts filling up a 5-step form.
c) During the 3rd step, the user leaves without completely finishing the form.
d) Some days later, the user comes back and logs in to see that his inputs are all gone!

This happens because Gravity Forms by default does not save partially submitted forms.

Our plugin resolves this issue. Simple!

== Installation ==


<h4>Installation</h4>

1. Upload extracted folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
